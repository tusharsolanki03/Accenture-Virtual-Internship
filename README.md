**Accenture Virtual Internship**

This was a scenario based project created by accenture team on the forage platform.

In this scenario I was working as a Data Analyst at Accenture within a larger team, where each member has a different role and level of responsibility and my team has been assigned a new project for a client called Social Buzz.

Brief about the client: Social buzz is a new platform where content takes center stage. Social Buzz emphasizes content by keeping all users anonymous, only tracking user reactions on every piece of content. There are over 100 ways that users can react to content, spanning beyond the traditional reactions of likes, dislikes, and comments. This ensures that trending content, as opposed to individual users, is at the forefront of user feeds. Over the past 5 years, Social Buzz has reached over 500 million active users each month. They have scaled quicker than anticipated and need the help of an advisory firm to oversee their scaling process effectively. Every day over 100,000 pieces of content, ranging from text, images, videos and GIFs are posted. All of this data is highly unstructured and requires extremely sophisticated and expensive technology to manage and maintain. Out of the 250 people working at Social Buzz, 200 of them are technical staff working on maintaining this highly complex technology.

They are expecting the following:

An audit of their big data practice
Recommendations for a successful IPO
An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity.
My objective was to do analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity.

First step: Data Cleaning Data cleaning is a common and very important task when working with data Clean the data by: • removing rows that have values which are missing, • changing the data type of some values within a column, and • removing columns which are not relevant to this task For purpose of data cleaning MySQL was used. SQL queries were executed using the following keywords SELECT to retrieve data from specific columns, FROM to specify the table to retrieve data from, WHERE to filter data based on specific conditions, GROUP BY to group data based on specific columns, ORDER BY to sort data in ascending or descending order, JOIN to connect the datasets based on related columns to get desired output.

Second step: Data Visualization Form the cleaned and combined dataset acquired from the previous step a data visualization is created using Power BI software. Power BI was used to create an interactive dashboard.

Here is the image showcasing the Power BI dashboards I have created.
